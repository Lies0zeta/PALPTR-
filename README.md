## Abstract
Machine learning methods usually rely on large sample size to have good performance, while it is difficult to provide labeled set in many applications. Pool-based active learning methods are there to detect, among a set of unlabeled data, the one that are the most relevant for the training. However, it usually relies on an initial training set (known as the cold-start problem). We propose in this paper a meta-approach for pool-based active learning strategies in the context of multi-class classification tasks. Proper topological regions are proposed using topological data analysis (TDA) tools to detect relevant regions to sample as cold start points or within the active learning scheme induced by theoretical considerations. The proposed method is illustrated empirically on various benchmark datasets, being competitive to the state-of-the-art methods from the literature.
